## Abstract 

Microbial ecologists routinely use $\beta$-diversity metrics to compare communities, yet these metrics vary in the ecological dimensions they capture. Popular for incorporating phylogenetic relationships, UniFrac distances default to relative abundance, omitting important variation in microbial load. As methods for estimating absolute abundance gain traction, incorporating this information into $\beta$-diversity analyses becomes essential. Here, we present *Absolute UniFrac* ($U^A$), a variant of Weighted UniFrac that uses absolute abundances. Through simulations and a freshwater case study, we show that Absolute UniFrac captures both microbial load and phylogenetic relationships, improving statistical power to detect ecological shifts. However, it is also sensitive to variation in microbial load, especially when abundance changes occur along long branches, potentially amplifying differences. We therefore recommend a generalized form ($GU^A$) with a tunable $\alpha$ parameter to balance sensitivity and interpretability.
